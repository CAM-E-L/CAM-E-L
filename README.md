# Overview of our Cognitive-Affective Map tools

abbrevation: Cognitive-Affective Map = CAM

- **data collection:** Cognitive-Affective Map Extended Logic (C.A.M.E.L.) is a software to draw CAMs with an easy and intuitive interface, see: https://github.com/Camel-app/DataCollection
- **data analysis:** the CAM-App is programmed in Shiny using the R environment (+ Python modules) to analyze the resulting Cognitive-Affective Map data using an interface, see: https://github.com/Camel-app/DataAnalysis
- **administrative panel:** the administrative panel provides basic information of the CAM-tools, links to all programmed tools and a detailed documentation, using the panel it is easily possible to set up studies

 (Wickham, 2021). The logic of the CAM-App follows the principle of a classical data-analysis pipeline (e.g. Peng & Matsui, 2016; Wickham & Grolemund, 2017), whereby the application is composed of two steps: 




App!

CAM tools make building in-browser Cognitive-Affective Maps (CAMs) easy. It’s a simple, graphical interace to help setting up CAM studies using our Cognitive-Affective Map extended logic (C.A.M.E.L.) software. The resulting data can be analyzed using our developed CAM-App.
