üëã Welcome to our tools of the  Cognitive-Affective Map (CAM) research Team at the University of Freiburg (see [CAM-Research](https://www.psychologie.uni-freiburg.de/abteilungen/Allgemeine.Psychologie/research/cam-research)). Me [Julius Fenn](https://github.com/FennStatistics), supported structurally and conceptually by [Florian Gouret](https://github.com/Aodarium), programmed the CAM tools. I personally trained in Psychology, Statistics, and Web-Development (self-taught), currently based in Germany üá™üá∫.

üî≠ I build tools that make new research tools easier accessible
    
‚öôÔ∏è I use a lot of: .r, .js/.ts, .html, css, .json and some .py

üí¨ Ask me about possible collaborations or research ideas - I happy to hear from you: <cam.contact@drawyourminds.de>
